Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

Cafe Class
-I chose to overload the cafe subclass constructor to the one with only an address and name because cafe's are usually only one floor. 
-I also overloaded the restock function so that only coffee could be restocked because that is the item that will probably run out the most. 

Library Class
-I overloaded the isAvailable function so that the user can check if two books are available at the same time. I thought this would be usedful so the user woudn't have to go through this function multiple times to see if every book is available. 
-I also overloaded the containsTitle function so that the user can check if two books are in the collection at the same time which would be helpful to improve efficiency. 

House Class
- I chose to overload the house sublclass constructor to the one with only an address and the number of floors because usually (non-smith) houses don't have names.
- I also chose to  overlaod the isResident method so that the user can see if two people are residents simultaneously which would be helpful to find out if people are roomates. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think that this assigment went pretty well! I was able complete it mostly on my own, which I think shows my growth. Additionally, I think I have a better understanding of overiding and overloading! Something I could have done better is planning out what I am going to code or what I am going to alter in existing code, but overall I think I did a good job.
