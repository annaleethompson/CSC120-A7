Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I overloaded the cafe subclass to the constructor with only an address and name because cafe's are usually only one floor. 
- threw a runtime exception for the gotoFloor function

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
